# README - Practising different search algorithms
## Below typical search algorithms are coded with sample state sapce stored as a dictionary. Key differences in the steps among different algorithms are presented in the code.
• Breadth-First Search (BFS): First-in First-out (Queue)  
• Depth-First Search (DFS): Last-in First-out (Stack)  
• Uniform Cost Search: The cost between two nodes (prior knowledge) is taken into consideration  
• Best First (Greedy) Search: The *estimated* cost from current state to goal state (aka heuristic function) is used  
• A* Search: Combination of uniform cost and best first search algorithms
